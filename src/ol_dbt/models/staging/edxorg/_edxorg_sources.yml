      description: str, whether the learner completed the course run. 'true' if a
        verified learner has earned a certificate in a course run that counts towards
        program completion. This is based on the user's course certificate in the
        LMS. A course certificate counts towards completion if the learner has passed
        the course and the course run mode matches the mode of the course. Learner
        certificates for unverified accounts do not count towards program completion
        until the account is verified.

        the certificate was generated for that verified learner.
    - name: date program certificate awarded
      description: str, the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ' in UTC that

        the learner enrolled in this course run for the first time. For example, if

        this value would represent the time that they enrolled in the course run for
        the first time.

        the learner last unenrolled in this course run. This will be null if the learner

        in the course run, unenrolled, reenrolled, and then unenrolled, this value
        would represent the most recent time that they unenrolled in the course run.
