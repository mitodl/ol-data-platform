    as follows 'If you completed 14.009x Good Economics for Hard Times before the
    launch of the Public Policy Track in fall 2023, you can apply the course to the
    International Development Track indefinitely. However, if you completed 14.009x
    before fall 2023 and wish to apply it to the Public Policy Track, it cannot be
    counted towards the International Development Track. In this case, you will need
    to complete two other International Development Track electives excluding 14.009x)
    and the three core courses to earn the International Development credential. Starting
    from fall 2023, completing 14.009x will only be credited towards the Public Policy
    Track.' Users can recieve both DEDP certificates but only count 14.009x once
